# ðŸŒ¸ Machine Learning Project â€“ Iris Flower Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building a supervised machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**.
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset widely used for pattern recognition and machine learning demonstrations.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

* Perform **data cleaning** and preprocessing on the Iris dataset.
* Conduct **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and correlations.
* Apply multiple classification algorithms for prediction.
* Evaluate model performance using standard metrics.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Steps Followed

1. **Data Loading** â€“ Imported the Iris dataset from an Excel file.
2. **Data Preprocessing** â€“ Checked for missing values and standardized features.
3. **EDA** â€“ Visualized data using scatter plots, pair plots, and histograms.
4. **Model Building** â€“ Used algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and KNN.
5. **Model Evaluation** â€“ Measured accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## ðŸ“Š Results

* Achieved **high accuracy (>95%)** on the test dataset.
* Random Forest and KNN performed the best among tested models.
* Visualizations confirmed clear separation between species based on petal and sepal measurements.
